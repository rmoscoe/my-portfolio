## Description 

[Visit the Deployed Site](https://rmoscoe.github.io/my-portfolio/)

I built this responsive website as a portfolio to showcase my work. The projects in my portfolio demonstrate my skill with a variety of technologies, as well as my evolution as a developer. The portfolio itself also serves as an example of my skill with HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Node.js, the Bulma CSS framework, and the React front-end framework.
